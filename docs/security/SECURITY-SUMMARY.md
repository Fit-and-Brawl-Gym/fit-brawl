- No system information exposed
- CSP nonce support
- User-friendly messaging
- Action buttons (home, back, retry)

### Log Rotation
**Impact**: 🟡 Medium - Prevents disk space issues

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/rotate-logs.sh` - Bash script (Linux/Mac)
- `scripts/rotate-logs.bat` - Windows batch script
- `scripts/rotate_logs.php` - PHP script (cross-platform)

**Configuration**:
